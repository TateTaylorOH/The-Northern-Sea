The Sea of Ghosts is divided into three regions: the hospitable and relatively safe [Dunbarrow Passage](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#dunbarrow-passage), the treacherous and pirate-filled [Shipwreck Archipelago](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#shipwreck-archipelago), and the mysterious and haunted [Phantom Waters](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#phantom-waters).

# Dunbarrow Passage

The Dunbarrow Passage is a small region that comprises of only three islands. It is relatively safe compared to the rest of the Sea of Ghosts and hosts a single settlement: the titular Dunbarrow. The passage runs between Dunbarrow to the west and Seabright Lighthouse to the east, Fort Hamar sits towards the center of the two and protects traffic through the waterway. This is the most common route that ships will take will traveling from Skyrim's ports into the Sea of Ghosts.

## Dunbarrow

To the south sits the small village of Dunbarrow. The people there survive almost purely off fishing and, despite the community's size, is able to export a considerable amount of extra fish to the mainland via their contract with the East Empire Company. Dunbarrow is said to be the birthplace of the infamous pirate captain Torradan ap Dugal.

# Shipwreck Archipelago

Shipwreck Archipelago gets its name for how dangerous these waters are. They are dotted with rocks and the rough waves of the region has sent many a sailor to his death. Only the most foolhardy merchants travel through the archipelago, usually determined to make better time than their rivals. The only ones who are comfortable in these waters are pirates, many of whom have become so comfortable navigating the dangerous terrian that they have made it their permanant home.

## Republic of Pirates

The Republic of Pirates is a fledgling democracy located in an dangerous archipelago that has become to resting place of many shipwrecks. The entire Republic is constructed out of the salvage of decades of sunken ships that have found their place in the archipelago which has led to a peculiar looking shantytown built atop of several spires of rock. The Republic was founded by Captain Hastein Flame-Beard when he finally united the disparate groups of pirate crews across the Sea of Ghosts. They needed to stick together or powers like the East Empire Company would ultimately destroy them. In the Republic every man belongs to himself and has the choice of what crew he wants to serve. Captains are elected democratically by the ship's crew and leaders can be ousted at any time. Flame-Beard himself acts as a mediator between all of the oftentimes not-so-friendly crews. The Republic has existed in an uneasy peace for around two years, but the cracks have begun to show. The Blood Horkers had left the Republic and claimed it had made everyone too soft. More recently, Flame-Beard's old rival Dragan took his crew and mysteriously left in the dead of night. The crews have began to question Flame-Beard's ability to lead and the viablity of their Republic as a whole.

## Fort Travail

## Shipwreck Island

Just east of the Republic of Pirates, Shipwreck Island is said to be haunted by the souls who made it from wrecks in the nearby archipelago but still died on the island. It is dotted with old survivor camps, unmarked graves, and skeletons.

## Twin Islands

Two barren islands to the west of Dunbarrow.

# Phantom Waters

Far to the north lays the Phantom Waters. This area is infamous among sailors for being haunted. It is rarely traversed by merchants coming from port in Skyrim, however an important trade route between High Rock and Morrowind cut through these waters. Merchants tend not to stay in the area for long due to supersition. Pirates have long taken advantage of the area to raid the trade routes and turn a hefty profit. Recently the pirate active has been getting worse and worse, forcing the East Empire Company to establish a permendant martial presence in the region to ensure the flow of trade can continue uninterrupted.

## Abandoned Settlement

In the far northwest of the Sea of Ghosts an abandoned East Empire Company settlement can be found. It appears to have been establish some time in the Third Era, but no record of its existance can be found.

## Black Islet

## Fort Seagard

## Fort Jarmun

## Japhet's Folly
![](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/TateTaylorUSA/raw/main/assets/images/northern-sea/ScreenShot141.png)

The dream of an overly ambitious man, Japhet's Folly was built by its namesake, Japhet. However, the foolish Nord did not have the resources to maintain a citadel so far north and the harsh conditions of the region made the majority of his men desert him. Japhet died alone in his citadel and the fortress was ironically named after his foolishness. The Blood Horkers found the island and used it as a base briefly before being thwarted by the East Empire Compnay. With the raising pirate threat in the Sea of Ghosts it is becoming clear that the East Empire Company will need to establish some type of fortress in that area to protect their interests. Japhet's Folly has the proper infrastructure in place and it is in a desirable location making it the perfect candidate for an Company base in the north.

## Sanctus

In the center of the Sea of Ghosts sits the cursed ruins of Sanctus. Built in the Second Era to protect the northern shores of Tamriel from the invading Akaviri, the settlement was ultimately overrun by the onslaught of foreign invaders. The island is literred with the remains of ancient warriors, both Imperial and Akaviri. The only still-standing structure in the omonius Temple of Reman which overlooks to rest of the ruined town. The four sea forts present in the Sea of Ghosts were originally constructed to help defend Sanctus, they are now used by both pirates and the EEC to respectively help raid and protect trade routes.
