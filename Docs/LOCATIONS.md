In the far northwest of the Sea of Ghosts an abandoned East Empire Company settlement can be found. It appears to have been establish some time in the Third Era, but no record of its existance can be found.

To the south sits the small village of Dunbarrow. The people there survive almost purely off fishing and, despite the community's size, is able to export a considerable amount of extra fish to the mainland via their contract with the East Empire Company. Dunbarrow is said to be the birthplace of the infamous pirate captain Torradan ap Dugal.

### Japhet's Folly

The dream of an overly ambitious man, Japhet's Folly was built by its namesake, Japhet. However, the foolish Nord did not have the resources to maintain a citadel so far north and the harsh conditions of the region made the majority of his men desert him. Japhet died alone in his citadel and the fortress was ironically named after his foolishness. The Blood Horkers found the island and used it as a base briefly before being thwarted by the East Empire Compnay. With the raising pirate threat in the Sea of Ghosts it is becoming clear that the East Empire Company will need to establish some type of fortress in that area to protect their interests. Japhet's Folly has the proper infrastructure in place and it is in a desirable location making it the perfect candidate for an Company base in the north.

### Republic of Pirates

The Republic of Pirates is a fledgling democracy located in an dangerous archipelago that has become to resting place of many shipwrecks. The entire Republic is constructed out of the salvage of decades of sunken ships that have found their place in the archipelago which has led to a peculiar looking shantytown built atop of several spires of rock. The Republic was founded by Captain Hastein Flame-Beard when he finally united the disparate groups of pirate crews across the Sea of Ghosts. They needed to stick together or powers like the East Empire Company would ultimately destroy them. In the Republic every man belongs to himself and has the choice of what crew he wants to serve. Captains are elected democratically by the ship's crew and leaders can be ousted at any time. Flame-Beard himself acts as a mediator between all of the oftentimes not-so-friendly crews. The Republic has existed in an uneasy peace for around two years, but the cracks have begun to show. The Blood Horkers had left the Republic and claimed it had made everyone too soft. More recently, Flame-Beard's old rival Dragan took his crew and mysteriously left in the dead of night. The crews have began to question Flame-Beard's ability to lead and the viablity of their Republic as a whole.
