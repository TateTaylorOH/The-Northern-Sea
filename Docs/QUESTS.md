# Main Quest

The Main Quest will serve as a sort of sequel to Rise in the East. It will begin some time after Rise is completed. All the main quests will begin in Japhet's Folly.

## EEC1

You have completed Rise in the East and some time has passed. A guard tells you that the EEC is recruiting people at the East Empire Company warehouse in solitude. A quest to apply there is added. You head inside and see a ship that has docked there. You speak to a man named Florian who asks you your name. When you give it to him he acknowledges your accomplishments at Japhet’s Folly and establishes the EEC’s goals to build a chapter there. He mentions that given your previous work you can sign on as a Fixer. You sign some document (TG logbook) and receive a set of EEC armor and a share as a signing bonus.


## EEC2

When ready, you take the ship and arrive at Japhet’s Folly upon which Florian informs you that his boss Adelaisa is about to escort a valuable group of ships. You have a little down time but are suddenly assaulted by pirates at Fake Sanctus. Things go wrong and you wash up on the island, fast travel is now disabled. You are tasked with building a fire and a little survival mission in which you encounter the first clue to Ap Dugal's treasure hunt is found. You build the fire on the beach and an EEC trade ship picks you up. You head back to Japhet’s Folly and report to Florian on what happened. Florian tells you to wait for your orders while he assumes his position as the new head of the chapter and gets everything back in order. 
(Note for the Ap Dugal Treasure hunt: Real Sanctus will be recognizable to you because of the burnt out fire on the beach)

## EEC3

You return to Florian and he tells you that he will not make the same mistake of not knowing who he is up against. He tasks you with going to the retired pirate extraordinaire Flamebeard and asks you to convince him to come work with the company. You find Flamebeard at his home doing some extravagant Flamebeard things and find a way to convince him. He comes with you to Japhet’s Folly and explains to Florian who the Republic of Pirates are. He mentions that the EEC cannot defeat them because they cannot find them. Their ships are always mobile and they meet in different places every time. However, they still have to store their loot and he knows where each clan stores theirs. 
He establishes that these places are three static forts and gives some exposition about the clan running the first one and you go there and kill everyone. Flamebeard finds the first part of the Republic of Pirates code and explains what it is. You return to Japhet’s Folly and Florian tells you to do your thing while he and Flamebeard work together and tells you to talk to him and Flamebeard for the next two fort assaults, which you can do in either order.


 EEC3A

You talk to Florian about the next fort assault and he mentions something he achieved in your absence. He gives the exposition he received from Flamebeard about the next clan and you go out and deal with them like in Rise in The East, but with backup. You find another part of the code and return to Japhet’s Folly.


 EEC3B

You talk to Flamebeard about the next fort assault and he mentions something he and his men achieved in the meantime. He gives you the exposition about the clan you are about to face and you deal with them in a way befitting of a pirate. You find the last clue and return to Japhet’s Folly.


Once both EEC3A and EEC3B are complete Flamebeard uses the parts of the code he found to narrow the next meeting down to Shipwreck Island. Florian will gather the men and together they will plan their attack.


## EEC4

The preparations are ready, the whole fleet can be seen at the entrance and Japhet’s Folly is completely repaired and filled with troops. Flamebeard proposes he goes in disguised as himself and causes pandemonium so the rest of the EEC troops can come in uncontested. He’ll fire a firebolt or something recognizable so Florian knows when to come in. Florian on the other hand proposes going in the classic way of bombarding them from a distance and sending in troops. He proposes using Flamebeard’s ship for the bombarding since it has a lot more space for catapults, while he will use his ships to get the troops to land. They ask you about which approach you think is better and you give an answer and a reason why, which convinces whoever’s plan you did not pick. Florian settles the matter and you go out to destroy the Republic of Pirates with the plan you three agreed on.

 EEC4A

As Flamebeard’s catapults are bombarding Shipwreck Island you are sailing on Florian’s ship. You can interact with a rowboat to get on shore in a mini EEC D-Day, where you have to break through the well guarded entrance of the Republic of Pirates in some way. Florian is your follower in this section. You storm the place and once you make it in you kill all the pirates. Florian and Flamebeard meet up and you return to Japhet’s Folly.

 EEC4B

Flamebeard hoists the Elder Scrolls’ Jolly Roger and you enter the republic of pirates. He talks to someone there who tells him about how terrible things have been going lately and you walk into the camp. Suddenly one of the pirates there shouts that he recognizes you as an EEC member from the Adelaisa ambush. Flamebeard fires the signal and everyone starts killing everyone, Flamebeard is your follower in this section. The EEC comes in with the same rowboats from EEC4A and you kill the pirates. Flamebeard and Florian meet up and you return to Japhet’s Folly.

## EEC5

You arrive at the inn at Japhet’s Folly with Flamebeard and Florian have a drink with them. The conversation gradually leads you to the crow’s nest of Flamebeard’s ship which looks out over the completed Japhet’s Folly. Florian gives you a promotion from fixer to agent and a nice medal, explaining it’s not company policy to give these out anymore, but he thought that you should have one. (The amulet could have a non-functional enchantment text like The back of the medal reads: Awarded to [Player Name] for exceptional initiative and bravery in serving the EEC). Fade to black and you wake up in your quarters at the EEC, your final quest now completed.
