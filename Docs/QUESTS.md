# Main Quest

## Troubled Waters

- Some time after Rise of the East is complete you get a letter to meet an EEC rep named Florian in the Windhelm office.
- You meet Florian who thanks you for handling the Blood Horkers, but explains that the pirate activity in the Sea of Ghosts has, strangely, gotten worse after the Blood Horkers were defeated. Trade on the High Rock - Morrowind corridor is worse than ever. [Japhet's Folly](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#japhets-folly) is in a good position to protect their interests in the Sea of Ghosts and act as a staging ground for offense against pirates. He takes you to see Japhet's Folly.
- You get a tour of the place, everything is ruined but not on fire. Workers mill about working on the island. The two Towers of Japhet's Folly have already been repaired. After the tour Florian asks if the Player would want to help them protect Japhet's Folly while it is being repaired. Florian offers them a share of stock in the Japhet's Folly division of the EEC and explains that they don't currently have the means of offering you gold. The Stock will be worth a non-trivial amount of gold from the start and can be cashed in at any time, but the more quests they do the more it will be worth.
- Florian tells you that the EEC believes the infamous Captain Hastein Flame-Beard is the leader of the resurgent pirate faction, but admits that it is strange that he is suddenly giving the EEC so much trouble when he'd been active in the region for a long time. You are sent to run protection on a sensitive shipment bound for an exchange in Solitude. 

## Private Interests

- You board the ship and during transit you are attacked by pirates. They appear to be normal pirates, but there are a few strange things about them, most notably that they are all wielding Elven weapons. You defeat them and make it to Solitude and back without issue.
- When you return Florian congratulates you on your successful mission and lets you know you will be contacted when they are in need of your services.

## Give No Quarter

- You receive a letter from Florian telling you to report to Japhet's Folly at the earliest convenience. When you arrive to Japhet's Folly the first level of the island has been repaired. It is explained that they had discovered pirates based out of a nearby [Sea Fort](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#fort-seagard) and it was in need of capturing.
- Go assault and capture the [Sea Fort](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#fort-seagard). There are subtle differences with this group of pirates. You capture the fort and find documents talking about how Flame-Beard's fleet had been having rough times lately and they'd been in constant conflict with an old rival faction of pirates, but who was once a nuisance is actively threatening Flame-Beard's supremacy. You return back to Folly and tell Florian what you found. He finds the new highly disturbing because the EEC was sure that Flame-Beard was responsible for the attacks on EEC ships, but these documents appeared to contradict that. You leave and wait to be contacted again.

## Frozen Assets

- You receive a letter telling you to report to Japhet's Folly. When you arrive the second level of the island is repaired. Florian explains that one of their ships recently went down in transit to Morrowind. You are sent to retrieve what cargo you can from the wreck. 
- When you arrive it is clear that the ship did not crash, but it was clearly destroyed in a battle. You find the cargo and the body of a Thalmor Justicar. On him is a letter linking the Thalmor to a group of rival pirates and details their plans to topple Flame-Beard's fleet and install their own privateers as the clear power in the Sea of Ghosts to continue to strain Imperial trade between their remaining provinces.
- When you report back Florian is highly disturbed by the news and makes it clear that this evidence cannot leave the island because it would cause an international scandal. However, he knows that they can't just let the Thalmor disrupt EEC shipping. Florian tells you that they will need to think about the situation. You leave.

## Dead in the Water

- You receive a letter telling you to report to Japhet's Folly. When you arrive the third section of the island is repaired. Florian tells you that they have a crazy plan. They explain that the Thalmor privateers are not only threatening the EEC in the region, but also Flame-Beard's fleet. He tells the Player that they are going to travel to Flame-Beard's fortified shanty town to negotiate a contract between the EEC and Flame-Beard. 
- The Player and Florian travel to Flame-Beard's "[Republic of Pirates](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#republic-of-pirates)" and speak with the pirate. Negotiations go poorly, but are interupted by an assault by Thalmor privateers. After fending off the attackers Flame-Beard grudgingly admits that they need eachother, at least for now. A contract is signed and Flame-Beard and his entire fleet is pardoned by the EEC so long that the contract is upheld.
- The Player and Florian return to Japhet's Folly and Florian talks about how it is going to get really interesting in the Sea of Ghosts (maybe he actually uses the term "Shadow War"). He tells the Player that the EEC was in a safe position for now but that they will need to begin fighting back against the Thalmor pirates.

# Side Quests

## The Shadow War

After the conclusion of the Main Quest several quests will begin to be offered by Florian and Captain Flame-Beard as part of the newly sparked "Shadow War" between the EEC and Aldmeri Dominion.

### Salvage Jobs (Japhet's Folly)

Florian will offer a radiant quest to go and salvage surviving goods from a shipwreck in order to turn some profit from the loss.

### Pirate Hunts (Republic of Pirates)

After capturing the three sea forts in the Sea of Ghosts Captain Flame-Beard will begin to offer a new combat-centric radiant quest where you board his flagship and hunt for Thalmor ships to board and sieze.

### Sea Fort Assaults (Republic of Pirates/Japhet's Folly)

Both Florian and Captain Flame-Beard will offer a special series of quests where you travel with one of the two to retake several [sea forts](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#sea-forts) that had fallen to the Thalmor Privateers. The assaults will happen in two phases, the first phase involves disabling the enemy catapults in order to make landing at the fort safe. The second phase involves laying anchor at the fort and taking it by foot. You can start a sea fort assault by talking to either Flame-Beard or Florian, whoever you go with will determine what faction takes control of the fort, there will be slightly different rewards depending on who you choose.  There are only three Sea Forts in the Sea of Ghosts (not counting the one seized during *Give No Quarter*) so this quest is not endlessly repeatable.

## Treasure of Captain Torradan (Dunbarrow)

The Player goes on an island-hopping treasure hunt to find the lost treasure of Torradan ap Dugal.

## The Lost Colony (Republic of Pirates)

Unravel the mystery of an [abandoned settlement](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#abandoned-settlement) farther north than any previously known inhabitation.

A distress letter comes to Japhet's Folly from an [isolated lighthouse](https://github.com/TateTaylorUSA/The-Northern-Sea/blob/main/Docs/LOCATIONS.md#seabright-lighthouse). You are asked to investigate the situation, however, there may be more to the message than meets the eye...
