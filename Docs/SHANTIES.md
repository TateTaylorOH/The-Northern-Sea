## The Sea It Rises 
The sea it rises with a mighty roar\
The wind it blows from a distant shore\
The waves they speed us on our way\
The ship she dances in the spray!

All hands to halyards, hoist away!\
Set sails to full and no delay!\
The course we set we must sail true\
Or sink ourselves in the briny blue!

Look to the port above the beach\
Our destination we will reach\
For our captain's is a will of steel\
Break his trust and you'll kiss the keel!

The sea it settles on the shore\
The wind will blow us nevermore\
The waves are calm, there is no spray\
Our ship sets sail some other day. 

## Oblivion Shanty #1
Ho hey, sweet lady of Wayrest!\
Ho hey, sweet lady of mine!\
Oh I'll see you again, yes I'll see you again, sweet lady of Wayrest so fine!

## Oblivion Shanty #2
There once was a hardy young lad of the sea\
A Redguard of courage and honor was he\
Sail on, my Cyrus, sail on

## Leyawiin Girls by Michael Way (Mway1)

Our fleet's leaving Ebonheart loaded with ore,
The Tiber, the Seadrake, the Guar and the Shor;
The Trades blowing hard, and the sea is afoam,
But our Leyawiin girls are all calling us home 

Goodbye Vadramea, Drolora and all,
We're sailing for Cyrod to answer the call,
Mothers, and lovers, and daughters hold true,
We're trimming the sails to come right home to you. 

We've rounded Telvannis and past Necrom's quay,
Left Dres' waters where none can be free;
The Jel's on the deck feel the pull of the Hist,
But it's Leyawiin's girls we are sailing to kiss. 

Goodbye Vadramea, Drolora and all,
We're sailing for Cyrod to answer the call,
Mothers, and lovers, and daughters hold true,
We're trimming the sails to come right home to you. 

We stop off in Lilmoth to load up with grain,
Sell a few trinkets, then set sail again;
95 leagues, then were into the Bay,
And its Leyawiin's girls we'll be kissing today 

Goodbye Vadramea, Drolora and all,
We're sailing for Cyrod to answer the call,
Mothers, and lovers, and daughters hold true,
We're trimming the sails to come right home to you. 

We've made our safe landing, unloaded the lot
Paid out our Septims, then off on the trot 
And who's on the jetty, all smiling with glee?
The Leyawiin girl who's been waiting for me.
