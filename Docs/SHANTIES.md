## The Sea It Rises 
The sea it rises with a mighty roar\
The wind it blows from a distant shore\
The waves they speed us on our way\
The ship she dances in the spray!

All hands to halyards, hoist away!\
Set sails to full and no delay!\
The course we set we must sail true\
Or sink ourselves in the briny blue!

Look to the port above the beach\
Our destination we will reach\
For our captain's is a will of steel\
Break his trust and you'll kiss the keel!

The sea it settles on the shore\
The wind will blow us nevermore\
The waves are calm, there is no spray\
Our ship sets sail some other day. 

## Oblivion Shanty #1
Ho hey, sweet lady of Wayrest!\
Ho hey, sweet lady of mine!\
Oh I'll see you again, yes I'll see you again, sweet lady of Wayrest so fine!

## Oblivion Shanty #2
There once was a hardy young lad of the sea\
A Redguard of courage and honor was he\
Sail on, my Cyrus, sail on
