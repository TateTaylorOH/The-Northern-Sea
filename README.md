Some time after the quest Rise in the East you will recieve a letter from a courier. The letter will thank the Player for helping the East Empire Company assault Japhet's Folly and will request help once again.

The Player will travel to Windhelm and board a boat to Japhet's Folly.

When they arrive the island will be in much the same state the Player left it, except there are East Empire Wardens and sailors milling about and repairing structures. The Player is approached by a Company Representative that explains that they think the island would make for an excellent sea fortress to help secure Company interests in the Sea of Ghosts. The problem is that the fortresss is in dire need of repairs. The representative will tell the Player that the Company could no offer gold recompensation for their help, but they would offer them a piece of stock in the Company after each milestone is met.

The Hearthfire system will be used to repair the exterior and interior of Japhet's Folly. There will be a small docks and services on the outside and a barracks and offical Comapny office on the inside. 

Each of the services below will need to be built using the Haerthfire system:

- General Merchant OR Smithy (for normal trading purposes)
- Tavern (for a food vendor)
- Barracks (for guards to stay, you'd also need to hire new guards)
- Docks (for travel around Skyrim)
- Offices (for radiant quest giver)

After each thing is constrcuted you will be given a new stock and the value of all your stocks will increase. You can sell your stocks at any time.

After everything is constructed you will be thanked and given a unique East Empire Pendent as a reward.

The Offices will provide the player with special radiant quests. These will involve retriving supplies from shipwrecks, delivering packages, and going on "pirate hunts" where you are taken to a water-filled worldspace on the high seas and tasked with boarding and clearing a pirate ship. 

If Lawbringer is installed you will be able to claim nautical locations and shipwrecks for the Company. If a shipwreck is claimed it will appear repaired in Japhet's Folly.
